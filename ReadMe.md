# Password Manager App

An command line application that we built for our java and object-oriented
programming course.We also applied our knowledge of discrete mathematics for encryption and decryption.

## Why we built this app?

Because in our current day and age most people use websites for a lot of things and some of those websites require us to create accounts and those accounts requires a password to acess.But it is often times seen that as the number of accounts grow we start using same password for every account which can be very risky. So a password manager like this help us create unique password for different account and store them so that if we forget it we can get the password from a safe place from this application.

## What we learned

- Package's in Java
- Exception Handling in Java
- File I/O
- Encryption and Decryption using Ceaser Cipher
- Passowrd generation using Random Library of Java
